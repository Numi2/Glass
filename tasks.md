# Developer Tasks for Enhancing the Landmarks App

To transform the static "Landmarks" app into a dynamic, community-driven platform with user-generated content, the following developer tasks are proposed:

## 1. User Authentication and Profiles

*   **Task**: Implement user registration and login functionality.
    *   **Details**: Integrate with a secure authentication service (e.g., Firebase Authentication, Auth0, or a custom backend authentication system).
    *   **Sub-tasks**:
        *   Design and implement user interface for sign-up and login.
        *   Handle user sessions and secure token storage.
        *   Implement password reset functionality.
*   **Task**: Create user profiles.
    *   **Details**: Allow users to manage their public profile, including a username, profile picture, and a brief bio.
    *   **Sub-tasks**:
        *   Design and implement profile editing UI.
        *   Store user profile data persistently.

## 2. Persistent Data Storage for User-Generated Content

*   **Task**: Migrate from in-memory data to a persistent backend.
    *   **Details**: Replace the current `Landmark.exampleData` and `LandmarkCollection.exampleData` with a robust database solution.
    *   **Considerations**: Evaluate and integrate with either SwiftData (for local and iCloud sync) or CloudKit (for cloud-based data storage and sharing across users).
    *   **Sub-tasks**:
        *   Define data models for `User`, `UserLandmark`, and `UserCollection` in the chosen persistence framework.
        *   Implement data migration strategies if necessary.
        *   Develop data access layer for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

## 3. User-Generated Landmarks

*   **Task**: Enable users to create new landmarks.
    *   **Details**: Provide a form or interface for users to input landmark details (name, description, location coordinates, images).
    *   **Sub-tasks**:
        *   Design and implement a "Create New Landmark" UI.
        *   Integrate image upload functionality (to cloud storage like Firebase Storage or CloudKit Assets).
        *   Implement location picking on a map.
        *   Validate user input.
*   **Task**: Allow users to edit their own landmarks.
    *   **Details**: Enable owners to modify the details of the landmarks they have created.
*   **Task**: Implement functionality for users to delete their own landmarks.

## 4. User-Generated Collections

*   **Task**: Enable users to create custom landmark collections.
    *   **Details**: Users should be able to name their collections, add descriptions, and select landmarks (both their own and public ones) to include.
    *   **Sub-tasks**:
        *   Design and implement a "Create New Collection" UI.
        *   Implement a landmark selection interface for adding to collections.
*   **Task**: Allow users to edit their own collections.
*   **Task**: Implement functionality for users to delete their own collections.

## 5. Social Features

*   **Task**: Implement a "Follow" feature for users.
    *   **Details**: Allow users to follow other users to see their public landmarks and collections.
*   **Task**: Enable content sharing.
    *   **Details**: Allow users to share links to their public landmarks and collections via system share sheets.
*   **Task**: Implement a discovery feed or section.
    *   **Details**: Showcase popular or recently added user-generated landmarks and collections.
    *   **Sub-tasks**:
        *   Develop algorithms for content ranking (e.g., by popularity, recency).
        *   Design and implement the discovery UI.
*   **Task**: Add commenting and liking functionality for landmarks and collections.

## 6. Backend & API Development (if not using BaaS like Firebase/CloudKit extensively)

*   **Task**: Develop a scalable backend API.
    *   **Details**: This would be necessary to handle user authentication, content storage, and social interactions if a comprehensive BaaS solution isn't fully adopted.
    *   **Sub-tasks**:
        *   Design RESTful APIs for all user-generated content and social features.
        *   Set up a cloud database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
        *   Implement server-side logic for data validation, security, and business rules.

## 7. Enhanced UI/UX for User-Generated Content

*   **Task**: Improve the user experience for content creation forms.
    *   **Details**: Implement more interactive controls, potentially including sliders or custom pickers for certain data points (e.g., elevation, area).
*   **Task**: Design clear indicators for user-generated vs. app-provided content.
*   **Task**: Implement search and filtering for user-generated content.
